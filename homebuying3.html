                    <h2>Home Buying App</h2>
                    <p> <b>Prompt: </b>"Real Cool Realtor (RCR) is a Columbus realty company that is looking to improve the experience for a first time house buyer. 
                        They have noticed over the past 20 years that while their first time buyer clients only make up about 5% of their customer base, about 90%
                        of their first time buyers return to RCR for the purchase of their next home. However, a lot of their first time buyers only become clients
                         because their parents are also customers.
                        <br>
                        <br> As result, RCR is looking for a way to interest first time buyers to work with them, and they think the utilization of technology may
                         be a way to differentiate their business from other local competitors! Having something that can aid first time buyers through the process 
                         more quickly and easier will prove a better experience and may result in more clients becoming interested in working with them. RCR’s
                          president Joe Realty, however, it does want to define and create the best technological solution that would also support their larger customer
                           base, which are primarily returning customers that are buying their next house upgrade.
                           <br>
                        <br>Talking with their top analyst (aka you!), you proposed to build a smartphone app that can be used by first time buyers. Joe Realty is very
                         excited to hear invest, but needs to hear some more details…"
