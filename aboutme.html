									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/AboutMe/headshot.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a recent graduate in Management Information Systems from The Ohio State University. I have knowledge in web technologies 
									using Angular, React, ASP.Net, Node.js, REST API, HTML, CSS as well as with other coding languages such as Java, COBOL, SQL,
									 Javascript, and VBA. Not only that, but I am also well equiped with a business background as well as user experience skills
									 that allows me to thrive in understanding what my consumers want. I have experience in product management through my time
									 at The Ohio State University and Visa where I created a product from concept to launch. Outside of school, I can be seen watching basketball,
									  catching up with tech news, working on coding challenges online on HackerRank, and finding awesome movies and tv shows to watch and tv shows to watch.
								</p>
								<p> As a graduate of OSU, I am a huge Ohio State fan as well as the culture there. During my time there, I was part of Alpha Phi Omega,
									a national service fraternity, and Phi Sigma Pi, an honor fraternity. Being apart of two fraternities as well as having a job at the time and 18-credit
									hours for most semesters, I learned to juggle many things at my table as well as network with my groups and beyond the group.
								</p>
									</p>
								<p>I have put some projects of my code, systems analysis, UI design, and my resume on here. Go ahead and send me an email if you have any question.
